            The score package, with its subpackages such as omr.score.midi,
            handles the logical music information inferred from recognized
            glyphs extracted from the physical sheet, and the internal
            representation of such score can be stored on an external support
            using various data formats, such as Midi or MusicXML.

            This is a (somewhat obsolete picture of the) hierarchy of classes :
            Score, Page, System, Slur, Stave, Measure, etc... <img src=
