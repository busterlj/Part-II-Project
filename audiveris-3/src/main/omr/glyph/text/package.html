            How textual glyphs are handled
        </h2>
        <h3>

            Glyphs selection
        </h3>
        <p>
            The general idea is to come up with glyphs that are very likely to
            correspond to real text. Such glyphs are assigned a textual Shape,
            that is either the Shape TEXT or the Shape CHARACTER. Glyph
            candidates come from 3 sources:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard glyph creation by section aggregation or glyph
            aggregation. This bottom-up strategy is implemented in {@link
            omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#retrieveGlyphs}
            </li>
            <li>Specific area division, starting from rectangular area at
            system level, then subdivision along horizontal and vertical axes.
            This top-down strategy is implemented in the {@link
            omr.glyph.text.TextArea} class.
            </li>
            <li>Individual glyph assignment by user manual interaction.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>
            Glyphs processing
        </h3>
        <p>
            The special processing for textual glyphs is triggered during the
            PATTERNS step, which among other patterns, calls the {@link
            omr.glyph.text.TextInspector#runTextPattern} method.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working at a system level, this method does the following:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Retrieve additional textual glyphs (see the area division, as
            described above),
            </li>
            <li>Retrieve alignments of textual glyphs into instances of {@link
            omr.glyph.text.Sentence}
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure no textual glyphs overlap (see {@link
                    omr.glyph.text.Sentence#mergeEnclosedTexts})
                    </li>
                    <li>Try to aggregate non-textual glyphs that may exist on
                    the line (see {@link
                    omr.glyph.text.Sentence#includeAliens})
                    </li>
                    <li>Merge sentences close to each other via {@link
                    omr.glyph.text.TextInspector#mergeSentences}.
                    </li>

                    <li>Finally, try to recognize each retrieved sentence
                    through {@link omr.glyph.text.Sentence#recognize} which
                    uses the OCR feature provided by the Tesseract tool.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Process each Sentence in sequence:
            </li>
        </ol>
    </body>
