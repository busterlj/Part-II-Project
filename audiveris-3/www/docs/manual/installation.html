            There is now one single distribution per release which, besides the
            binary components and user manuals, provides source code, JavaDoc,
            build procedures, training material, etc. Example:&nbsp;audiveris-3.3-full-20100519.zip
        </p>

        <p>
            Just download the latest distribution (about 30MB) and expand this archive into some

            <li>
                <b>OS</b>: Audiveris is essentially a Java application, and as
                such should be usable on a wide variety of platforms. It is
                today being developed under <b>Windows</b> and&nbsp;<b>Linux</b>. It has run on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mac&nbsp;OS</span>
for some time, but the connection to Tesseract is not yet implemented
for this platform.&nbsp; Since release 3.2a, Audiveris uses <strong>Google Tesseract OCR</strong> for the translation
                    of textual glyphs. Tesseract was developed in C++ and is
                    OS-dependent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Java</b>: <b>Java&nbsp;6</b> is highly recommended since it
                already contains the <b>JAXB&nbsp;2</b> component which is
                needed for XML persistency. If you cannot use Java 6, you can
                use <b>Java&nbsp;5</b> but you will have to download
                <b>JAXB&nbsp;2</b> from the <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB web site</a> and install it
                on your own.

        <p>

            Tesseract OCR is a C++ program and Audiveris is a Java application.
            For the time being, the JNI connection between Audiveris and Tesseract
            has been implemented for Windows and Linux only.
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            For <strong>Windows</strong>
environment, the Tesseract "tessdll.dll" component is used, via the
Tesjeract Java companion. No specific installation is required, all the
needed software&nbsp;comes with the full Audiveris distribution. In
particular, you no longer need to install Microsoft C/C++ runtime, nor
define the <strong style="font-weight: normal;">TESSDATA_PREFIX variable.</strong>
        </li><li>
            For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux</span> environment, [[[<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">wait for James indications</span>]]]
        </li></ul>

            components</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
            All the other components need no special installation procedure,
            since their jar files are already provided in the
            <strong>dist/lib</strong> folder of the Audiveris installation
            directory and directly referenced from the manifest of the
            Audiveris jar file. See the Implementation manual if you need more
            detailed information on these components.
