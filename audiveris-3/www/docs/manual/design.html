<p> Purpose of this design manual is to present the rationale for
key design decisions within the Audiveris application.</p>

<a name="PIXEL_HANDLING">
<h2>Pixel Handling</h2>

</a>
<div class="axial"><a name="PIXEL_RUNS">
<h3>Pixel Runs</h3>

</a>
<p> The most basic entity handled by a lag is a run, although a
run is a stand-alone entity that can be used outside of any containing
lag. A run is a
sequence of foreground pixels (we don't consider runs of background
pixels for this application, except for the initial scale computation).
All the pixels of one run are contiguous
pixels in the same orientation (all runs are horizontal for a
horizontal lag, and similarly in a vertical lag, all runs are defined
as vertical sequences of pixels).</p>

<h5>Foreground vs. Background</h5>

<p>In Audiveris, lag runs are created by processing a provided
image, where pixels are defined as levels of gray. The only degree of
freedom is the precise gray level value that separates a rather white
pixel (thus assigned to background) from a rather black pixel (thus
assigned to foreground). This value is a symbolic constant in class
omr.sheet.Picture, and is assigned value 227 (pixels levels are in the
range 0 .. 255).&nbsp;Any pixel whose level is higher than or equal
to this value will be considered as foreground.</p>

<p>Runs are created by an instance of class RunsBuilder, which
needs an adapter to access individual pixels and to do whatever
processing is needed at the end of each run read :</p>

<ul>

  <li>A RunsBuilder is thus used by the ScaleBuilder to retrieve
all vertical runs, both foreground and background runs, and the most
frequent lengths of these two populations of runs provide the global
scaling of the page. In that case, runs are used in a stand-alone way,
i.e. not as part of a lag.</li>

  <li>A RunsBuilder is also used in the building of lags, to take
care of the very first phase which is getting the collection of runs,
the second phase being the creation of sections from these runs.</li>

</ul>

<a name="LAG_SECTIONS">
<h3>Lag Sections</h3>

</a>
<p>Sections are collections of runs. Within a given section, all
runs are stuck side by side. In a horizontal lag, all sections are made
of runs piled one on top of the other. A vertical lag is more like
Manhattan.</p>

<h5>Junctions</h5>

<p>The main question is&nbsp;to determine
when a section&nbsp;ends. On both edges of a section, the termination
can be trigerred by:</p>

<ul>

  <li>No run immediately stuck. There is just no foreground
pixel, thus no run, when we try to extend the last section run, the
edge run.</li>

  <li>More than one run stuck to the edge run. The section thus
"diverges" into several sections, and this section boundary if referred
to as a "junction".</li>

  <li>One single run is available just next to the edge run, but it is
determined as not being "compatible" with it. Typically, we use the
length of the candidate run and compare it with&nbsp;the length of
the edge run. A JunctionPolicy is used to determine if this candidate
run is compatible.</li>

</ul>

Sections are created by an instance of SectionsBuilder, which thus
populates its related lag, according to the provided JunctionPolicy.<br>

<h5>Lag instances in Audiveris</h5>

<p>Beside a tiny lag allocated for each synthetic SymbolIcon,
Audiveris
application uses 3 lag instances based on pixels from the same sheet
picture in the
following order:
</p>

<ol>

  <li>"<span style="font-style: italic;">sLag</span>", a horizontal lag created by SkewBuilder, is used
for&nbsp;computing the global skew angle of the sheet. Note that
this lag cannot be reused for the next step for two reasons: First,
only runs of significant length are built, since we are interested
only in long sections to determine skew trends, and thus many pixels
are discarded though they are present in the original image. Second, when
a rotation is needed because the sheet must be deskewed, a new
(rotated) image is generated and thus all pixels are impacted.</li>

  <li>"<span style="font-style: italic;">hLag</span>", a horizontal lag created by LinesBuilder and reused
by HorizontalsBuilder, is used to retrieve staff lines and horizontal
sticks (ledgers for example). At the end of horizontal processing,
certain pixels are erased because they were part of the removed staff
lines. New ones are created to extend objects that were crossed by the
former staff lines, so that these objects get their normal appearance
back, as if no staff line had ever been drawn upon them.</li>

  <li>"<span style="font-style: italic;">vLag</span>", a vertical lag created by BarsBuilder and reused by
all subsequent steps, is used to retrieve vertical sticks (barlines,
stems) but also glyphs with no particular orientation.</li>

</ol>

<a name="GLYPHS">
<h3>Glyphs and Sticks</h3>

</a>
<p>Glyphs are collections of sections. These sections are
actually instances of GlyphSection, a subclass of Section, which keeps
a reference back to the containing glyph. A GlyphLag is a lag augmented
with a collection of glyphs.</p>

<p>How sections are assembled to form a glyph can use any
arbitrary logic:</p>

<ul>

  <li> Glyphs made to retrieve and recognize symbols are built
out of&nbsp;sections which are connected to each other, either
horizontally or
vertically. Sections that are connected only in diagonal are not
connected
strongly enough to be members of the same glyph.</li>

  <li>Sticks, which are glyphs with an internal Line equation,
are built to retrieve long
filaments such as staff lines, or shorter ones such as horizontal
ledgers or vertical stems. In the case of sticks, sections are
assembled according to a rather complex logic which is implemented in
class SticksBuilder. A SticksBuilder instance is dedicated to the
rectangular area it has to scan. Audiveris application uses instances
of (subclasses of) SticksBuilder in 5 different occasions:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>In step LINES, there is one LineBuilder instance per each
candidate staff line area to build the actual staff line. Section
filtering is based on vertical position of the horizontal section (it
must be located in the staff line area).</li>
    <li>Still in step LINES, other instances of LineBuilder are also
used to scan areas where staff lines are interrupted due to missing
pixels. They use the same source, so the same section filtering, that
is used for the main staff line retrieval.</li>
    <li>In step HORIZONTALS, one single HorizontalArea instance is used
to retrieve horizontal dashes (ledgers and endings) in the whole sheet.</li>
    <li>In step BARS, one single instance of VerticalArea is used to
retrieve barlines in the whole sheet. A section predicate is used to
keep only the sections that are not successfully assigned (their result
derives from FailureResult). [<span style="font-style: italic;">TBD: Check whether there is&nbsp;duplication between "result" and "assigned glyph" criteria]</span></li>
    <li>In step VERTICALS, one single instance of VerticalArea is used
to retrieve stems in the whole sheet. A section predicate keeps only
sections that are assigned to either no glyph or assigned to just noise
or structure glyphs.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>Whether we build mere glyphs or specific sticks, the assembly
is made out of a population of "available" sections, that is&nbsp;sections
not yet assigned to a recognized
glyph, or assigned to a recognized glyph that we want to break apart. An example
of such breaking can be found in Structure shape: In the early symbol
recognition step,&nbsp; a Structure glyph (assembly of notes, stems and beams all
connected together) can be built and recognized as a Structure. Then, in
a later step, some of its sections will be reused to build vertical
sticks (the stems) while the remaining sections will be assembled into
leaf symbols (the hote heads, the beams).</p>

<h5>Link between glyph and its member sections</h5>
<p>While sections in a Lag (or GlyphLag) are built once for all,
the containment link between sections and glyph is more volatile:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Glyphs (and sticks), if not assigned to a final shape,
may have
their member sections reassembled in other glyphs (see the Structure
example above).</li>

  <li>Several glyphs may be merged into a bigger glyph, a
Compound, which will contain all the sections of the former glyphs.
This is typically the case of a F clef, for which the staff line
removal often leads to a segmentation between the left and the right
parts of the F clef.</li>

</ul>
What physically defines a glyph is the collection of its member
sections. Through out&nbsp;the various glyph and stick extractions, the
same collection of sections may lead to new instances of glyphs/sticks
which in fact represent already existing glyphs. And since some
properties may be attached to a glyph (as of today, we keep a set of
forbidden shapes per glyph), we want to keep these properties even if a
"new" glyph has been created out of the very same member sections. To
do this, we handle a GlyphSignature, based on simple physical
characteristics (weight and contour box), to detect identical glyphs.
And the set of forbidden shapes for a given glyph is in fact not
directly attached to the glyph but handled by a map using the glyph
signature as key.</div>
